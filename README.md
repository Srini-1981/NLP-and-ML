# NLP-and-ML
Wanted to some of the sharable work I did and alos the learnings I got from several years in the space of DS, AI and ML.
Every notebook and code has its own description explaining the processes.
Right now in the process of cleaning up the code and writing the description, will be uploading notebooks one by one so watch this space!
