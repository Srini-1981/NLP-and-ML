# NLP-and-ML
Wanted to share some of the sharable work I did and also the learnings I got from several years in the space of DS, AI and ML.\
Every notebook and code has its own description explaining the processes.\
Right now in the process of cleaning up the code and writing description, will be uploading notebooks one by one so watch this space!\

Could not certainly say that the code written and shared here is 100% correct, learning never ends so please feel free to correct and collaborate so that we can learn from each other. Thank You!
