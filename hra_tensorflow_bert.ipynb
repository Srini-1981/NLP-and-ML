    "* There are beautiful ways to approach the BERT problem using Huggingface Transformers with native Pytorch and Tensorflow libraries but this assignment is done with the mix of Scikit-learn and native Tensorflow where I am comfortable. We also used Pytorch and Huggingface based code to resolve some of the problems for out existing clients.  \n",
    "* Could not run this code in colab due to internet and session outages which frequently allowed to session disconnects consuming lot of time and also it is early to publish this code and run in Kaggle so could not utilize the GPU and decided to run this experiment in CPU laptop with 32 GB RAM.\n",
    "* From assignment perspective, no need to chase metrics so bought in below strategies to complete the assignment and experimentation in local machine and in time.\n",
    "    * Down sized the dataset to the least class sample which is neutral sentiment so this experiment can run in CPU in shorter time, this can also be considered as one of the steps to deal imbalanced datasets and here it is not the objective\n",
    "    * Used small BERT to reduce the computational time\n",
    "    * Numerous BERT experiments can be done but limited to this one due to time and computational complexity\n",
    "* This notebook or codebase shows the apporaches towards the problem and also provides various tools and techniques further can be used to solve the problem or to take next level.\n",
    "* Tried to provide functional explanation for most of the cells\n",
    "* What further can be done to make this work more useful (I know this is not part of the assignment):\n",

    "    * A simple deployment using flask and waitress, exposing it as rest API\n",
